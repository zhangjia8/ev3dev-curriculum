The sandbox is a place for you to individually learn about the EV3 robot.
You need to work all of the TODO items in your folder to learn about that
features of the EV3 robot.  You can refer to the `/examples` folder
for information about the api or visit one of these websites:

Official python-ev3dev documentation:<br>
http://python-ev3dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Someones efforts to help provide examples just like the `/examples` folder:<br>

**TODO: 1.**
From left to right where your team is sitting now assign each person a number.<br>
The person farthest to the left is team member #1, on their right is team member #2,
on their right is team member #3, and if you have a 4th person they are team member #4.
You will use that number to help you avoid messing up one another's work in your shared
team repository. Conflicts in git can be resolved, but it's easier to just avoid them.

The subfolders m1, m2, m3, and m4 that are within this `/sandbox` folder are all identical.
- Team member #1 (fill in your own name here) will work all of the TODOs in the m1 folder
- Team member #2 (fill in your own name here) will work all of the TODOs in the m2 folder
- Team member #3 (fill in your own name here) will work all of the TODOs in the m3 folder
- Team member #4 (fill in your own name here) will work all of the TODOs in the m4 folder

**TODO: 2.**
Fill in your name above then do a VCS -> Commit.. -> Commit and Push.
As others fill in their names do a VCS -> Update project.
After all names are in, then team member #1 can remove unused rows if needed.
Additionally team member #1 can mark the TODOs above as DONE.
Other team members can do an VCS -> Update project to see that change.

Side note:
Additionally you will notice there is a `/sandbox/src` folder.
If you REALLY mess up while implementing your member folder you can always
refer to the src folder to see what the given code looked like.  Nobody should
edit any code within the `/sandbox/src` folder.  It is meant to be a pristine original copy
of the given sandbox source code.
